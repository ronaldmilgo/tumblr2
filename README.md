# Project 6 - Tumblr Detail

Submitted by: **Ronald Milgo**

**Tumblr Detail** is an app that displays photo posts from the *Humans of New York* Tumblr blog and lets users tap a post to view a larger version with its caption.

Time spent: **~5 hours** spent in total

- [x] Setup navigation to the Detail Screen

## Notes

- I encountered a Git push issue due to missing authentication tokens, which I resolved by switching to a manual upload approach. I also learned how to use segues, pass data between view controllers, and display dynamic content based on API responses.
- The HTML content returned by the Tumblr API required trimming to display captions cleanly.
